# Performance evaluation of DWT and LSB method for Steganography

===============================================
Data secrecy became a main concern in the recent period. Many new techniques are employed to hide the secret data in some or the other form. This method of hiding the data into another form is called as Steganography. Likely, an old term in Ancient Greek, Steganography is derived from steganos meaning “concealed” and graphein meaning “writing”. This paper emphasizes on the two major techniques employed in Steganography – Discrete Wavelet Transform and LSB Substitution.
